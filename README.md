#### Note about ES6 & jQuery

Most of the code in this project has been written in ES6 JavaScript and jQuery. The code is compatible with modern web browsers and future-proofing JavaScript & jQuery code. 
-- In fact, ES6 is so improved that I am thinking in the future to remove jQuery. I believe that removing jQuery it
will optimize the code.
